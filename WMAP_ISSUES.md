# wmap Issues Found via tsmap

This file tracks wmap library issues discovered while building tsmap.
At some point these will be converted into an implementation plan for wmap.

## Rust Backend Notes

### `rust-stdf` ATDF feature is unusable

`rust-stdf` v0.3.1 has an `atdf` feature flag but the implementation is
incomplete. `AtdfRecord` has a private `data_map` field with no public
accessors — the only public method is `to_atdf_string()`. The
`From<&AtdfRecord> for StdfRecord` conversion is a TODO stub that returns an
empty record.

**Current workaround:** ATDF is parsed in TypeScript (`atdfParser.ts`). This
works but means ATDF cannot benefit from Rust performance for large files.

**Options when we add a `parse_atdf` Rust command:**

1. Wait for `rust-stdf` to complete its ATDF implementation
2. Write our own ATDF parser in Rust — ATDF is ASCII line-by-line, the format
   is well-specified, and the field layouts are already documented in
   `atdfParser.ts`. A Rust implementation would be ~200 lines.

Option 2 is likely faster than waiting. The field positions are already mapped
in `atdfParser.ts` — porting to Rust is mechanical.

## API Issues

### 1. `renderWaferMap` missing `downloadFilename` option

`renderWaferGallery` accepts `options.downloadFilename` to customise the PNG
save filename. `renderWaferMap` hardcodes `a.download = 'wafermap.png'`
regardless of context. The host has no way to suggest a meaningful filename
(e.g. the loaded file's stem).

**Fix:** Add `downloadFilename?: string` to `RenderOptions` in `renderWaferMap`.

### 2. `openHtmlReport` uses `window.open` — not embeddable

`openHtmlReport(html)` calls `window.open('', '_blank')` then writes HTML into
the popup. In Tauri (and any non-browser host), `window.open` is blocked and
returns `null`, silently doing nothing. The "Open Report" and "Summary report"
buttons in the summary panel are therefore broken in tsmap without a workaround.

**Fix:** Add a `setReportOpener` function to the wmap public API:

```ts
setReportOpener(opener: (html: string) => void): void
```

`openHtmlReport` checks for a registered opener before falling back to
`window.open`. The summary panel buttons call `openHtmlReport` internally and
remain unaffected. The host calls `setReportOpener` once at startup.

Do not change `openHtmlReport`'s signature or deprecate it — wmap's own summary
panel buttons call it internally and would break.

### 3. ~~`wrapWithSummaryPanel` uses `height: 100%` on a flex child — broken on WebView2~~ (fixed)

`summaryPanel.ts: wrapWithSummaryPanel()` set `height: '100%'` on the wrapper
div, which is a flex child of whatever container the caller provides. In a pure
flexbox layout, `height: 100%` on a flex child only resolves correctly if the
parent has an explicit declared height — not a flex-given height. WebKitGTK is
lenient; WebView2 (Windows) is strict and collapses the wrapper to zero height,
breaking the summary panel layout.

**Fix applied:** Replaced `height: '100%'` with `flex: '1 1 0'` and added
`minHeight: '0'` on the wrapper, matching the pattern already used on the
content element.
